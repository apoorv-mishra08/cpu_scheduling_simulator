# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator built using Python and Streamlit. It supports the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apoorv-mishra08/cpu_scheduling_simulator.git
**Install the necessary Python packages:**

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run cpu_scheduling_simulator.py


Algorithms
FCFS: Executes processes in the order they arrive.
Round Robin: Processes are executed in a circular order with a fixed quantum time.
SJF: Executes processes in the order of the shortest burst time.
